# project: test-dbt-slimci
testing slimci/continuous integration setup in dbt cloud, CI jobs are a special type of dbt cloud job that will aim to only run impacted models (by your changes) on each PR. its an important strategy if you have a fairly large project and don't want to run every model or test on each invokation of dbt.

## dbt cloud features used
- versionless - *we will use* versionless dbt in this project
- *we are testing* "Continuous integration jobs in dbt Cloud". continuous integration (CI) jobs run when a new pull request (PR) is opened. CI jobs run and test only modified models, ensuring efficient use of resources and a faster development process
- note: concurrent ci checks are only available in team or enterprise editions for dbt cloud - we will not use it in this test
- note: we will not be testing sql linting (team or enterprise) or sqlfluff in this test
- [advanced ci](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/advanced-ci) will *not be used* in this test (this is only available in enterprise editions). advanced ci enables comparing data changes between environments during ci
  - prerequisites to advanced ci:
    - You have a dbt Cloud Enterprise account.
    - You have Advance CI features enabled.
    - You use a supported data platform: BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, or Snowflake. Support for additional data platforms coming soon.

## project package management & integrations
 - we will solely use the dbt cloud ide to maintain the project and all integrations
 - remote is github
 - data warehouse is snowflake

## ci job

### setup in dbt cloud ui
the best way to get this working on a free/test account with github is to go to your [account settings](https://cloud.getdbt.com/settings/profile) and link github using oauth here 

### ci behavior
when using/setting up ci jobs in dbt cloud we need to run a deploy job first to enable CI jobs since initially it has no runs to compare against unless you do so.
- Triggered by pull requests - This feature is only available for dbt repositories connected through dbt Cloud's native integration with GitHub, Gitlab, or Azure DevOps
- Commands â€” By default, this includes the `dbt build --select state:modified+` command. This informs dbt Cloud to build only new or changed models and their downstream dependents. Importantly, state comparison can only happen when there is a deferred environment selected to compare state to. Click Add command to add more commands that you want to be invoked when this job runs.
- When CI jobs run The default schema will be overridden as a temporary schema prefixed by `dbt_cloud_pr_` where models will be materialised during the pr merge check
- *Optional Setting* Run on draft pull request (Optionally run CI on draft PRs)
- github will show merge checks on PR which look like: "Some checks havenâ€™t completed yet: 1 pending check @dbt-cloud dbt Cloud Pending â€” dbt Cloud run pending" click on "details" to jump into the dbt cloud job id
 - merge checks that need to materialise new models do so in `dbt_cloud_pr_` and once a PR is merged the `dbt_cloud_pr_` schema will be dropped
- the CI job will not deploy changes into the environment it will only materialise things in `dbt_cloud_pr_` schema, another job must handle deployment
- if a change was detected but not deployed into the target environment, additional CI checks will materialise the changes into the temp schema

```

above summary: since dbt has identified no changed models from the repository it has nothing to do, nothing run in snowflake.
